###Scenario
Imagine you are in the Wild West (1800s America) and you are helping bring order along and law enforcement across several states. Your team has been assigned to capture as many wanted criminals as possible. A key incentive is that the criminals have bounties that you’ll be awarded with. Your job is to maximize the bounties and manage your risks. Using data we want you to come up with a compelling strategy on how you’ll do this.

###Data
The data is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lj9RQMstyVYLr6o_Spk6wHhcTMJuZ4xrJoP3XrE6dj0). Note that it includes hidden columns which you do not need to worry about. 

| Fields              | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                | Not all outlaws have a name.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Current Affiliation | Most outlaws are independent, some are part of a gang. Gangs represent a tradeoff, they’re an opportunity to capture many fugitives at once but they’re potentially more dangerous. |
| Charge              | There are 5 charges. They could be used as an indication of violence and sophistication of the criminal.                                                                            |
| Jurisdiction        | There aren’t many roads in the territories.                                                                                                                                         |
| Bounty              | Maximize their bounty.                                                                                                                                                              |
| Last Seen           | Indication of who would be easiest to find. Perhaps.                                                                                                                                |

###Instructions
Using the data file, your knowledge of movies, and your intuition, create a plan for your posse for the next four months. Be explicit about your assumptions (i.e., We’re taking a train to Oklahoma and then traveling by horseback). Maximize returns (bounties!), and limit your risks (i.e., gunfights with dangerous outlaws!). Once you have a plan, support your plan with data from the most wanted list. Please keep the plan brief. Before you get started, just a few thoughts. Prioritize and maximize bounties, and remember that some villains are more dangerous than others. How much risk are you willing to take? Finally, you’ve only got four months, it takes time to travel in the territories and time to track a villain.

###Deliverables
Draft a one-page memo and create a five minute presentation of your plan to make America safer by maximizing bounties while limiting risk. Support that plan with the analysis of the data provided. Once you’ve finished, submit all deliverables to this@email.gov. Your work will be reviewed to determine if an in-person interview is the appropriate next step. If so, you will present your plan at the beginning of the interview.
